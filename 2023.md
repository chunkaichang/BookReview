### The Soul of A New Machine
- Author: Tracy Kidder

- Review: A documentary novel about how a 32-bit machine was built in 1980s. Overall, I feel it is too lengthy and scattering for me, but the author did a good job explaining the problems in plain words. As a person who also builds machines, I can totally relate to how uneasy the debugging process was. My favorite quote from the book is "... the thrill comes from knowing that the thing you designed works, and works almost the way you expected it would. If that happens, part of *you* is in that machine."
