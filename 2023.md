### The Soul of A New Machine
- Author: Tracy Kidder
- Lables: Computer :computer:
- Review: A documentary novel about how a 32-bit machine was built in 1980s. Overall, I feel it is too lengthy and scattering for me, but the author did a good job explaining the problems in plain words. As a person who also builds machines, I can totally relate to how uneasy the debugging process was. My favorite quote from the book is "... the thrill comes from knowing that the thing you designed works, and works almost the way you expected it would. If that happens, part of *you* is in that machine."

### Chip War: the fight for the world's most critical technology
- Author: Chris Miller
- Lables: History :classical_building:
- Review: An overview of the chip industry's history. Chip war has been going on soon after the first transistor was invented. Good to know the stories behind the current and the used-to-be major players in the industry such as Japan used to be the largest DRAM manufacturer and Micron was backed by a potato tycoon in Idaho. Writing is good and easy to digest.

### Moonwalking with Einstein: the art and science of remembering everything
- Author: Joshua Foer
- Labels: Science :microscope:, History :classical_building:
- Review: A story about a journalist spending a year to become a mental athlete. I totally understand how visualize things (the Memory Palace technique) can be useful for memorizing stuff as well. What's more interesting to me are the side stories and discussion interewoven along the main story. My takeaway is that although it sounds waste-of-time to devote time to improving memory, what we are today and our behavior tomorrow are based on memories from yesterday.
