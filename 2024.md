## Jan-March
### The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann 
- Author: Ananyo Bhattacharya
- Labels: History :classical_building:
- Review: Not an easy read, but contains lots of information. I was overwhelmed by the long digression in each chapter and thus feel the content in each chapter being unstructured. Figures are out-of-place for some reason.

### Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures
- Author: Merlin Sheldrake
- Labels: Science :microscope:
- Review: Informative and insightful. Good to know that truffles are fruits of fungi, existense of astrobiology, zombie fungus that infects ants, Wood Wide Web, drunken mokey hypothesis, and more. Lots of examples resonate with the phenotye evolution theory that I learned from The Selfish Gene. I agreed with the author that we should not try to understand everything through human/plant/animal's perspective.

### How to Make Things Faster: Lessons in Performance from Technology and Everyday Life
- Author: Cary Millsap
- Labels: Computer :computer:, Philosophy :bulb:
- Review: Introducing framework for performance analysis and optimization. Organized as a series of short chapters and easy to read. Probably the most accessible resource that I have read so far on this topic.

## April-June
### Eloquent JavaScript
- Author: Marijn Haverbeke
- Labels: Computer :computer:
- Review: Read the free [online version](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html). Nice intro to JS. Examples are interesting. The only chapter that was not clear to me at first read is promises. Fortunately, [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) explains the concept well.

### Sandworm
- Author: Andy Greenberg
- Labels: Computer :computer:, History :classical_building:
- Review: Stories behind cyber attacks that crippled infrastructure such as power grid, transportation, hostipals, etc. Unlike physical wars, cyber attacks exist in the space without borders where nearly everybody can become a victim someday. They are powerful in that they can indirectly lead to all sort of damages: physical, economical, and psychological. In terms of countermeasures, besides preventing damages, it is also crucial to have plans on how to quickly recover from attacks (e.g., fallback to analog dependencies).

## July-September
### A Guide to The Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy
- Author: William B. Irvine
- Labels: Philosophy :bulb:
- Review: Intro to philosophies of life and techniques used by Stoics to attain tranquility. I like how he reasoned the validity of Stoic concepts before accepting or rejecting each of them. I also can't help but relate the concepts to my low energy-state theory.

### Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies
- Author: CÃ©sar Hidalgo
- Labels: Philosophy :bulb:, Science :microscope:
- Review: Interesting concepts on definitions of entropy (in both information theory and thermodynamics) and the conditions to keep information growing (energy flow, solids, and computing). Life, as information generator, tends to form networks in different scales to break individual's computational limit. Societies and economies are example networks developed to amplify information growth.

## Oct-Dec
### Learn C++ by Example
- Author: Frances Buontempo
- Labels: Computer :computer:
- Review: Nice intro of modern C++ features. Examples are interesting. Would recommend for people who want some hands-on experience to refresh their C++ skills.

### Nexus
- Author: Yuval Noah Harari
- Labels: History :classical_building:
- Review: Interesting concepts of information networks behind politics, bureaucracy, religion, witch hunts, etc. It also emphasized the importance of self-correcting mechanisms in human societies and how computer algorithms will play a role in the near future.
