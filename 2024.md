### The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann 
- Author: Ananyo Bhattacharya
- Labels: History :classical_building:
- Review: Not an easy read, but contains lots of information. I was overwhelmed by the long digression in each chapter and thus feel the content in each chapter being unstructured. Figures are out-of-place for some reason.

### Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures
- Author: Merlin Sheldrake
- Labels: Science :microscope:
- Review: Informative and insightful. Good to know that truffles are fruits of fungi, existense of astrobiology, zombie fungus that infects ants, Wood Wide Web, drunken mokey hypothesis, and more. Lots of examples resonate with the phenotye evolution theory that I learned from The Selfish Gene. I agreed with the author that we should not try to understand everything through human/plant/animal's perspective.

### How to Make Things Faster: Lessons in Performance from Technology and Everyday Life
- Author: Cary Millsap
- Labels: Computer :computer:, Philosophy :bulb:
- Review: Introducing framework for performance analysis and optimization. Organized as a series of short chapters and easy to read. Probably the most accessible resource that I have read so far on this topic.
